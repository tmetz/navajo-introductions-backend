## Information

This is the back end API for the "Navajo Introductions" application.  This SPA (Single Page Application) walks a user through selecting their four clans (mother's, father's, maternal grandfather's, and paternal grandfather's), then constructs the formal introduction in Navajo language.  This introduction is used in social situations and presentations.
