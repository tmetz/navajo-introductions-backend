### Introduction

(Disclaimer: I am a non-native student of Navajo culture, not an expert. I welcome corrections to this information - email me at [tammy@tammymetz.com](mailto:tammy@tammymetz.com))

This is the front end API for the "Navajo Introductions" application.  This SPA (Single Page Application) walks a user through selecting their four clans (mother's, father's, maternal grandfather's, and paternal grandfather's), then constructs the formal introduction in Navajo language.  This introduction is used in social situations and presentations.


Navajo Introductions is a SPA (Single Page Application) to generate a personalized greeting for someone, in Navajo language, based on their 4 clans.

### Background

An important part of Navajo culture is introducing yourself with your 4 clans. This establishes kinship (who you are related to), which is extremely important. You should have 4 different clans, and you cannot marry someone with the same clan as you.

Your 4 clans come from your mother, father, maternal grandfather, and paternal grandfather. Since Navajo culture is matrilineal (passed down through the mother), you do not need to list your grandmothers (for example, your maternal grandmother's clan is the same as your mother's clan). For a great explanation, read [this article from the Arizona Republic newspaper](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/08/29/what-means-introduce-yourself-navajo-clan-system/2131456001/). and watch [this video from Navajo pharmacist Terry Teller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYAd9KuScoc&t=232s).

The clan groupings and color-coding I used mostly follow [this publication of Chinle Unified School District #24](http://www.chinleusd.k12.az.us/nclhome/files/2016/09/%E2%80%A2-Navajo-Clan-Names-Groups.pdf).
